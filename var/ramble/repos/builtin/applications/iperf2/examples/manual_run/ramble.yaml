# This is a ramble workspace config file.
#
# It describes the experiments, the software stack
# and all variables required for ramble to configure
# experiments.
# As an example, experiments can be defined as follows.
# applications:
#   variables:
#     processes_per_node: '30'
#   hostname:
#     variables:
#       iterations: '5'
#     workloads:
#       serial:
#         variables:
#           type: 'test'
#         experiments:
#           single_node:
#             variables:
#               n_ranks: '{processes_per_node}'
