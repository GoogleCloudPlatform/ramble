=====================================================
2) Writing an HPL application definition
=====================================================

This tutorial will provide an introduction to writing a more complex
application definition in Ramble. In this tutorial, you will create and test an
application definition file to run the `High-Performance Linpack (HPL)
<https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/>`_ benchmark.

This tutorial builds on the concepts introduced in the
:ref:`Basic Application Tutorial<basic_application_tutorial>` and introduces
new concepts such as software dependencies and input file templating.

It is a good idea to have a basic working understanding of how to create and
use Ramble workspaces before starting this tutorial. You should at least be
familiar with the content of the
:ref:`Hello World Tutorial<hello_world_tutorial>`.

Installation
============

To install Ramble, see the :doc:`../getting_started` guide.

**NOTE**: This tutorial requires a package manager to be installed and
configured to build HPL. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will focus on
Spack. You will need a working Spack installation and configuration on your
system for this tutorial. For more information on Spack installation or
usage, please refer to the `official Spack documentation <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Ramble
will leverage your configured Spack instance during the workspace setup stage
to build HPL.

Ramble Repositories
===================

Before writing our application definition, we will create a repository to house
the application definition.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble repo create tutorial-repo

This will create a new directory named ``tutorial-repo`` in your current
directory. Inside, directories will exist for each of the object types.

Once your repository is created, you can register it with Ramble by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble repo add tutorial-repo


HPL Application Definition
==========================

For the remainder of this tutorial, we will be writing and testing the contents
of the HPL application definition.

Create Application Definition
-----------------------------

To begin with, we will create an empty application definition file and a
placeholder for our input file template. These will live in the same directory.

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir -p tutorial-repo/applications/hpl/templates
    $ touch tutorial-repo/applications/hpl/application.py
    $ touch tutorial-repo/applications/hpl/templates/HPL.dat.tpl

For the remainder of this tutorial, ``ramble edit hpl`` will open this
file with the editor specified with your ``EDITOR`` environment variable.

Application Class
-----------------

Following the description of the application class in the :ref:`Basic
Application Tutorial<basic_application_tutorial>`, the following can be used as
the beginning of our HPL application definition.

.. code-block:: python

    from ramble.appkit import *

    class Hpl(ExecutableApplication):
        name = 'hpl'

At this stage, our application should show up in the output of ``ramble list``
and ``ramble info hpl`` should show limited information about this application.


Software Specification
----------------------

Unlike the ``hostname`` utility, HPL is not typically pre-installed. We need to
tell Ramble how to build it. We can do this using the ``software_spec``
directive. This directive takes a `Spack spec
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec_syntax.html>`_ to define the
software and its dependencies.

.. code-block:: python

        with when("package_manager_family=spack"):
            software_spec(name="hpl", pkg_spec="hpl@2.3")

This tells Ramble to use Spack to install HPL version 2.3. The ``with when(...)``
construct makes these directives conditional on the package manager being used.

**NOTE**: By default, Spack will be allowed to select any MPI implementation it
wants for this installation. Application definitions can optionally define
additional ``software_specs`` to further control the default software stack for
applications.

Input File Template
-------------------

HPL requires an ``HPL.dat`` input file to run. Ramble has directives for
downloading input files from websites. However, given this is a basic text
file, Ramble can generate this file from a template. We use the
``register_template`` directive to tell Ramble how to generate this file for
us. The documentation for the ``register_template`` directive can be found at
:py:meth:`ramble.language.shared_language.register_template`.

.. code-block:: python

        register_template(
            "hpl.dat.in",
            src_path="templates/HPL.dat.tpl",
            dest_path="HPL.dat"
        )

Now, let's populate the template file
``tutorial-repo/applications/hpl/templates/HPL.dat.tpl``. We can refer to any
workload variables we are going to add into the application definition using
curly brace syntax. When Ramble renders this file into the experiment
directory, these values will be expanded for us.

.. code-block:: jinja

    8            memory alignment in double (> 0)

Definition Experiment Constructs
--------------------------------

Now we will define the executable and workload for HPL.

Application Executables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HPL is an MPI application. We will define an executable that runs `xhpl`, the
HPL executable. We'll set ``use_mpi=True`` to tell Ramble to prepend the
workspace's MPI command to this executable. This allows users to run it with an
MPI launcher like `mpirun` or `srun`.

.. code-block:: python

        executable(
            "hpl-execute",
            "xhpl",
            use_mpi=True,
        )

Application Workloads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, we'll create a default workload that uses our executable. Given our input
file is generated from a template, we do not need to list it in the workload
specification.

.. code-block:: python

        workload(
            "default",
            executables=["hpl-execute"],
        )

Workload Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we have a workload defined, we can define the variables that we added
into our template input file (e.g. ``{Ns}``). We need to define them in our
application definition using the ``workload_variable`` directive so users can
set them.

.. code-block:: python

        workload_variable("Ns", default=1000, description="Problem size", workload="default")
        workload_variable("NBs", default=256, description="Block size", workload="default")
        workload_variable("Ps", default=1, description="Number of process rows", workload="default")
        workload_variable("Qs", default=1, description="Number of process columns", workload="default")

Analysis of experiments
-----------------------

Ramble can analyze experiment output to extract performance metrics and
determine success or failure.

Figure of merit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


HPL itself provides a mechanism for running several problem sizes in an attempt
to maximize the GFlops rating. To ensure we do not lose data when extracting
GFlops rating from HPL, we can create a figure of merit context to relate the
GFlops rating to the input parameters. We can then define the figure of merit
to exist within this context. The context can look like the following:

.. code-block:: python

        figure_of_merit_context(
            "problem-name",
            regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            output_format="N-NB-P-Q = {N}-{NB}-{P}-{Q}",
        )

This creates a new figure of merit context named ``problem-name`` which figures
of merit can be associated with. The context will have the ``N``, ``NB``,
``P``, and ``Q`` values associated with all figures of merit within. Since
HPL reports its performance in Gflops, we extract this value using the
``figure_of_merit`` directive with a regular expression.

.. code-block:: python

        figure_of_merit(
            "gflops",
            fom_regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            group_name="gflops",
            units="Gflops",
            contexts=["problem-name"],
            fom_type=FomType.THROUGHPUT
        )

Here we have associated the figure of merit with the ``problem-name`` and also
added the ``fom_type`` attribute to convey to users (and Ramble) that this is a
throughput metric.

HPL additionally outputs time for the experiments. We can track this as a
separate figure of merit:

.. code-block:: python

        figure_of_merit(
            "Time",
            fom_regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            group_name="time",
            units="s",
            contexts=["problem-name"],
            fom_type=FomType.TIME,
        )


Putting it all together
-----------------------

Our complete application definition at this point is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from ramble.appkit import *

    class Hpl(ExecutableApplication):
        name = 'hpl'

        with when("package_manager_family=spack"):
            software_spec(name="hpl", pkg_spec="hpl@2.3")

        register_template(
            "hpl.dat.in",
            src_path="templates/HPL.dat.tpl",
            dest_path="HPL.dat"
        )

        executable(
            "hpl-execute",
            "xhpl",
            use_mpi=True,
        )

        workload(
            "default",
            executables=["hpl-execute"],
        )

        workload_variable("Ns", default=1000, description="Problem size", workload="default")
        workload_variable("NBs", default=256, description="Block size", workload="default")
        workload_variable("Ps", default=1, description="Number of process rows", workload="default")
        workload_variable("Qs", default=1, description="Number of process columns", workload="default")

        figure_of_merit_context(
            "problem-name",
            regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            output_format="N-NB-P-Q = {N}-{NB}-{P}-{Q}",
        )

        figure_of_merit(
            "gflops",
            fom_regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            group_name="gflops",
            units="Gflops",
            contexts=["problem-name"],
            fom_type=FomType.THROUGHPUT
        )

        figure_of_merit(
            "Time",
            fom_regex=r".*?\s+(?P<N>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<NB>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<P>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<Q>[0-9]+)\s+(?P<time>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\s+(?P<gflops>\S+)",
            group_name="time",
            units="s",
            contexts=["problem-name"],
            fom_type=FomType.TIME,
        )


Final Tests
-----------

To complete this tutorial we will test the application.

First, create a workspace:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble workspace create -d tutorial-workspace -a

Now, add an experiment. We'll need to provide values for the number of nodes
and ranks. For HPL, the number of ranks should equal PxQ.

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble workspace manage experiments hpl --overwrite \
      -V package_manager=spack \
      -v n_nodes=1 \
      -v n_ranks=4 \
      -v Ps=2 \
      -v Qs=2 \
      -v Ns=2000 \
      -v NBs=256

Now, to complete the test we can execute:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble workspace concretize
  $ ramble workspace setup
  $ ramble on
  $ ramble workspace analyze

The ``ramble workspace concretize`` will pull the default software environment
and package specs from the HPL application and add it to the config. The 
``ramble workspace setup`` command will build HPL using Spack (if not
already installed), which can take some time. Then, the ``ramble on`` command
will run the experiment. After analysis, the result of these commands should be
the creation of a ``results.latest.txt`` file that contains the Gflops of your
machine, and the time spent running HPL.

Summary and Final Cleanup
-------------------------

At this stage, you have now created a new application definition to build and
run the HPL benchmark.

To clean up your system, make sure to deactivate your workspace before trying
to remove it.

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble workspace deactivate
  $ rm -rf tutorial-workspace

The application definition you have now matches some of the basic functionality
from Ramble's HPL implementation. You should now be able to compare your
definition from the one seen by using
``ramble edit --type base_applications -N builtin hpl``.
