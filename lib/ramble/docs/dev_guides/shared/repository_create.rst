Ramble Repositories
===================

Before writing our definitions, we will create a repository to house
the application definition. Repositories in Ramble can house any object type,
and are not limited to only those in this tutorial.

The ``ramble repo`` command is used to manage object repositories in Ramble. To
create a new repository, execute the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble repo create tutorial-repo

This will create a new directory named ``tutorial-repo`` in your current
directory. Inside, directories will exist for each of the object types. These
will include things like ``applications`` and ``package_managers``. Resulting
object paths in this repo would look like:

.. code-block:: console

    tutorial-repo/applications/hostname/application.py

You can also create a repository without object subdirectories using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble repo create tutorial-repo -d ""

In this case, the resulting structure looks like:

.. code-block:: console

    tutorial-repo/hostname/application.py

This latter layout allows objects with the same name but different types to
coexist in the same directory. For example, if there was a package manager
named hostname, it would exist in the following path:

.. code-block:: console

    tutorial-repo/hostname/package_manager.py

The remaining commands in this tutorial will assume your repository layout
matches the first example, but you can feel free to use either layout. Just map
any paths to the correct layout.

The actual object files within the repository are named based on the object
they represent. Below is a mapping of some object types to file names:

 * Application - ``application.py``
 * Base Application - ``base_application.py``
 * Modifier - ``modifier.py``
 * Package Manager - ``package_manager.py``
 * Workflow Manager - ``workflow_manager.py``
 * System - ``system.py``
 * Platform - ``platform.py``

As listed with the ``application.py`` file, each object also has a
corresponding ``base`` version, that is mostly use to help inheritance into
several concrete objects.

Once your repository is created, you can register it with Ramble by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble repo add tutorial-repo

**NOTE**: Ramble comes with a default ``builtin`` repository. Adding new
repositories gives them a higher precedence to other existing repositories.
Ramble uses this precedence ordering to decide which object definition is used
when multiple exist with the same name. Each repository has a namespace, and
these namespaces can be used to refer to specific instances of each object
definition.

Referencing Objects with Namespaces
-----------------------------------

When multiple repositories contain objects with the same name, or when you want
to be explicit about which repository an object comes from, you can use fully-qualified
namespaced specs.

Namespaced specs take the form:

* ``<namespace>.<object_name>`` (e.g., ``tutorial-repo.hostname``, ``builtin.wrf``)
* ``<namespace>.<type_abbrev>.<object_name>`` (e.g., ``tutorial-repo.app.hostname``, ``builtin.mod.my_modifier``)
* ``<namespace>.<type_abbrev>.<object_name>@<version>`` (e.g., ``builtin.app.wrf@4.2``, ``builtin.app.wrf@{version}``)

Common object type abbreviations include:

* ``app`` or ``application`` for applications
* ``mod`` or ``modifier`` for modifiers
* ``pkg_man`` or ``package_manager`` for package managers
* ``wm`` or ``workflow_manager`` for workflow managers
* ``sys`` or ``system`` for systems
* ``plat`` or ``platform`` for platforms

Base objects can be referenced with the ``base_<type_abbrev>`` prefix.

These namespaced specs can be used in CLI commands (e.g., ``ramble info <spec>``,
``ramble edit <spec>``, ``ramble create <spec>``) and in workspace configuration files
(``ramble.yaml``) under the ``applications:`` and ``environments:`` sections.
