Success Criteria
================

Ramble supports various methods of defining success criteria, which mark
experiments as successfully completed, or failed when analyzing a workspace.

This document describes the supported functionality, and how to use success
criteria in general.

-------------------------
Types of Success Criteria
-------------------------

Success criteria can be defined in two places:
* An application.py file
* A :ref:`ramble.yaml workspace config file<workspace-config>`

Success criteria defined in an application.py file applies to **all**
experiments this application generates. These are intended to provide more of a
"did my experiment complete" success criteria.

Success criteria defined in a workspace config file only applies to those
specific experiments. These criteria can evaluate if an experiment performed
adequately.

The ``application.py`` interface is documented in the
:ref:`application developers guide<application-dev-guide>`.

The rest of this document focuses on how to write success criteria in a
workspace configuration file. But it will describe general aspects of success
criteria that can apply to either definition.

-------------------------
Defining Success Criteria
-------------------------

Success criteria defined in a workspace config file are all merged together,
following the logic for optional sections in the workspace config file.

A block of success criteria is defined as a list of independent criteria that
should be evaluated.

.. code-block:: yaml

    success_criteria:
    - name: criteria1
      mode: 'string'
      match: 'Completed'
    - name: criteria2
      mode: 'application_function'

Success criteria can mix modes, and are all evaluated. If **any** success
criteria returns false, the experiment is marked as ``FAILED`` in the output of
``ramble workspace analyze``.

----------------------
Success Criteria Modes
----------------------

Each success criteria has a mode. Currently, there are three supported modes.

* ``'application_function'``
* ``'fom_comparison'``
* ``'string'``

We will cover each of these supported modes in more detail below.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mode: Application Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A success criteria with ``mode='application_function'`` will use an
application.py's defined ``evaluate_success`` function to test for experiment
success. This hook allows an application developer to perform more complicated
actions that are specific to the experiment.

**NOTE:** A success criteria with ``mode='application_function'`` is added by
default to all experiments. The base ``evaluate_success`` function always
returns ``True``.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mode: FOM Comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Success criteria with ``mode='fom_comparison'`` allow experiments to define
complex mathematical logic to evaluate success of an experiment. Defining
these criteria within a workspace configuration file is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    success_criteria:
    - name: my_criteria
      mode: fom_comparison
      fom_name: 'application_fom_*'
      [fom_context: 'fom_context_*']
      formula: '{value} > 1.0'

The above example shows the full interface for defining success criteria with
``mode='fom_comparison'``. The available attributes are:

* ``name``: The name of the specific criteria
* ``mode``: The mode of the specific criteria
* ``fom_name``: The name of the FOM to use for evaluating the formula
* ``formula``: The formula to evaluate for success.
* ``fom_context``: (Optional) The context ``fom_name`` should exist in. Defaults to ``null``.

Both ``fom_name`` and ``fom_context`` support
`python style globbing<https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html>`.

When using the globbing functionality, all contexts that match the
``fom_context`` argument are searched. Within each context, all FOMs that match
``fom_name`` are tested with ``formula``.

The ``formula`` attribute can access any variables defined within an
experiment. Additionally, an extra ``value`` variable is defined, which takes
the value of the FOM as extracted from the output.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mode: String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Success criteria with ``mode='string'`` allow experiments to define expected
string regular expression matching. This criteria mode is useful if an
application prints a string whenever it successfully completes. Defining these
criteria within a workspace configuration file is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    success_criteria:
    - name: my_criteria
      mode: 'string'
      match: '\s+Completed\s+'
      [file: '{log_file}]


The above shows the full interface for degining success criteria with
``mode='string'``. The available attributes are:

* ``name``: The name of the specific criteria.
* ``mode``: The mode of the specific criteria.
* ``match``: The regular expression used to test for success.
* ``file``: (Optional) The file (or variable that refers to a file) to test for the ``match`` in.

If ``match`` is found inside ``file`` this criteria is marked as success. If it
is not found, then the criteria is marked as failed.
