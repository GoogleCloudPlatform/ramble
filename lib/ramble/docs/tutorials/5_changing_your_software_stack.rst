============================
5) Changing A Software Stack
============================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to modify an existing workspace
configuration that contains experiments using
`GROMACS <https://www.gromacs.org/>`_, a free and open-source application
for molecular dynamics.

This tutorial builds off of concepts introduced in previous tutorials. Please
make sure you review those before starting with this tutorial's content.

Software Description
--------------------

Now that your workspace has been created, and configured with the default
workspace configuration file you can examine the workspace contents. You can
execute the following command to see what software environments and packages
the workspace currently contains:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace info

This command provides a summary view of the workspace. It includes the
experiment names, and the software environments. As an example, its output
might contain the following information regarding software packages and
environments:

.. code-block:: console

    Software Stack:
        Template package: gcc14 
          spack packages:
            Rendered package: gcc14 
              Spec: gcc@14.2.0 target=x86_64
              Compiler spec: gcc@14.2.0
        Template package: intel-mpi 
          spack packages:
            Rendered package: intel-mpi 
              Spec: intel-oneapi-mpi@2021.17.2 target=x86_64
              Compiler: gcc14
        Template package: gromacs-{application::gromacs::version} 
          spack packages:
            Rendered package: gromacs-2025.3 
              Spec: gromacs@2025.3
              Compiler: gcc14
        Template environment: gromacs@2025.3
          Base environment: gromacs@2025.3
            Packages:
            - gromacs-2025.3
            - intel-mpi


Currently, this command outputs every package and software environment
definition, even if they are not used directly by an experiment. By default,
each experiment expects a software environment that is named the same as the
application. For example, an experiment for the application ``gromacs`` expects
a software environment named ``gromacs``. This can be overridden using the
variable ``env_name``, which can be the name of any environment defined in the
workspace configuration file.


The relevant portion of the workspace configuration file is:

.. code-block:: YAML

    software:
      packages:
        gcc14:
          pkg_spec: gcc@14.2.0 target=x86_64
          compiler_spec: gcc@14.2.0
        intel-mpi:
          pkg_spec: intel-oneapi-mpi@2021.17.2 target=x86_64
          compiler: gcc14
        gromacs-{application::gromacs::version}:
          pkg_spec: gromacs@{application::gromacs::version}
          compiler: gcc14
      environments:
        gromacs@2025.3:
          packages:
          - gromacs-{application::gromacs::version}
          - intel-mpi

In this configuration, the ``packages`` block defines software packages that
can be used to build experiment environments out of. The ``environments`` block
defines software environments which can be used for the experiments listed
within the ``ramble:applications`` block. Keys within both ``packages`` and
``environments`` are the name of the package or environment (respectively).
Each environment has a ``packages`` block, which contains a list of package
names that are defined in the higher level ``packages`` block.

These are further documented in the
:ref:`Software configuration section<software-config>` documentation.

Changing Software Definitions
-----------------------------

In this workspace, we have ``variants:package_manager:spack`` which injects the
use of the ``spack`` package manager. You are able to change the package
manager through this variant option, however the remainder of this tutorial
will assume the package manager is ``spack``. When changing the software
definitions in a workspace, many options are available to you. For example, you
could modify the compiler used for building GROMACS (as controlled by the
``compiler`` attribute under the ``gromacs`` package definition), or you could
modify the MPI used for these experiments (as controlled by the ``intel-mpi``
package used within the ``gromacs`` environment's package list).  However, we
will explore changing aspects of GROMACS itself (such as its version or
variants). 

**NOTE:** It is important to note that changing aspects of
compilation could result in build-time errors that need to be resolved before
Ramble can generate experiments. Oftentimes it is both easier and faster to
work through these issues (if you encounter them) outside of Ramble, using the
package manager directly. Because Ramble uses the package manager, if the
package is already installed it will not cause the package manager to re-install
it.

In order to get information about what changes you can make to the GROMACS
package, you can use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ spack info gromacs


This command will output all of the supported versions of GROMACS, along with
the variants for GROMACS which can modify its behavior. While you can change
any of these, we'll begin by only modifying the version of GROMACS from
``2025.3`` to ``2025.4``.

To make editing the workspace easier, use the following command (assuming you
have an ``EDITOR`` environment variable set):

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace edit

This command opens the ``ramble.yaml`` file, along with any ``*.tpl`` files in
the workspace's ``configs`` directory.

Once the ``ramble.yaml`` file is opened, change the version ``2025.3`` to
``2025.4`` in the ``gromacs`` package definition. Then save and exit the files.
These changes should now be reflected in the output of:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace info


.. include:: shared/gromacs_execute.rst

**NOTE**: Since you changed the package definition for GROMACS, it will be
recompiled (unless you compiled it outside of Ramble) during the ``ramble
workspace setup`` command. This will likely take longer than changing
experiments and performing setup again.

Versions in Ramble
------------------

Ramble has its own versioning system in application definitions, which allows
for conditional statements based on versions and version ranges. We won't cover 
this in detail here, but you can view the versions that are known to Ramble with
the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble info --attrs known_versions -v gromacs

If a version of an application is not in Ramble, it can be added by modifying
the ``application.py`` file. See the :ref:`developer guide<application-dev-version-directive>`
for more details.

Adding Package Variants
-----------------------

So far, we have only explored changing the version a package used. More
complicated changes to the package specs can be made by adding variant
definitions. This can be directly added to the ``pkg_spec`` lines within the
package definitions in a workspace's ``ramble.yaml``.

The ``pkg_spec`` attribute can be parameterized with variable definitions
also, to allow a wide range of variants to be explored with a single
configuration.

Vector and Matrix Software Definitions
--------------------------------------

Package and environment definitions support the same vector and matrix logic as
introduced in :ref:`vector_and_matrix_tutorial`. Package and environment names
should similarly be unique, and can use placeholder values for variable
definitions.

As an example, to explore both of the versions of GROMACS described in this
tutorial, your ``ramble.yaml`` could look like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/vector_gromacs_software_config.yaml
   :language: YAML

Using this configuration file, you can examine what changes it would make to
your workspace through:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace info
    or;
    $ ramble workspace setup --dry-run


Changing Package Managers
-------------------------

The experiments in this tutorial assumed the use of ``spack`` as your package
manager. Ramble provides an option to change the package manager used in
experiments. The workspace used contains the following lines:

.. code-block:: yaml

  variants:
    package_manager: spack

This tells Ramble which package manager object to use when constructing the
experiments. The available package managers can be viewed using:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble list --type package_managers

In addition to any of these package managers, experiments can set
``variants:package_manager`` to either ``None`` or ``null`` to disable package
managers for the experiment.

Cleaning the Workspace
----------------------

Once your are finished with the tutorial content, deactivate your workspace using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace deactivate

Additionally, you can remove the entire workspace and all of its contents using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace remove basic_gromacs
