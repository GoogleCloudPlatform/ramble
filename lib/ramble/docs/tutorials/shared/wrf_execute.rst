Execute Experiments
-------------------

Now that you have made the appropriate modifications, set up, execute, and
analyze the new experiments using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace setup
    $ ramble on
    $ ramble workspace analyze

This creates a ``results`` file in the root of the workspace that contains
extracted figures of merit. If the experiments were successful, this file will
show the following results:

* Average Timestep Time: Time (in seconds) on average each timestep takes
* Cumulative Timestep Time: Time (in seconds) spent executing all timesteps
* Minimum Timestep Time: Minimum time (in seconds) spent on any one timestep
* Maximum Timestep Time: Maximum time (in seconds) spent on any one timestep
* Number of timesteps: Count of total timesteps performed
* Avg. Max Ratio Time: Ratio of Average Timestep Time and Maximum Timestep Time
