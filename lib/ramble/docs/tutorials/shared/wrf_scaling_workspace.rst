Configure Experiment Definitions
--------------------------------

To being with, you need to configure the workspace. The workspace's root
location can be seen under the ``Location`` output of:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace info

Alternatively, the files can be edited directly with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace edit

Within the ``ramble.yaml`` file, write the following contents, which is the
final configuration from a previous tutorial.


**NOTE**: This workspace utilizes the ``spack`` package manager. As a result, it
requires ``spack`` is installed and available in your path. Modifications to
the ``package_manager`` variant will change this behavior.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/wrf_scaling_config.yaml
   :language: YAML

The above configuration will execute 2 experiments, comprising a basic scaling
study on 2 different sets of nodes. This is primarily defined by the use of
vector experiments, which are documented in the :ref:`vector
logic<ramble-vector-logic>` portion of the workspace configuration file
documentation. Vector experiments were also introduced in the :ref:`vector and
matrix tutorial <vector_and_matrix_tutorial>`.
