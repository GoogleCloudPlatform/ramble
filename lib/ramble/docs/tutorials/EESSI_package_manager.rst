.. _eessi_package_manager_tutorial:

===============================
Using the EESSI Package Manager
===============================

In this tutorial, you will set up and run a benchmark simulation using
`GROMACS <https://www.gromacs.org/>`_, a free and open-source application
for molecular dynamics. The execution environment will be created and managed
using the
`European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI) package manager <https://www.eessi.io/docs/>`_.

This tutorial builds off of concepts introduced in previous tutorials. Please
make sure you review those before starting with this tutorial's content,
however this tutorial is fully stand-alone as far as steps you need to perform.

Application Information
-----------------------

As mentioned above, this tutorial uses the `GROMACS <https://www.gromacs.org/>`_
application definition. We will begin with the ``water_bare`` and ``water_gmx50``
workloads, as they are able to execute in a short amount of time.

Using a previously installed ``ramble``, the following command can be used to
get information about these workloads:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble info --attrs workloads -v -p "water*" gromacs

Under the workloads marked by ``Workload: water_bare`` and
``Workload: water_gmx50``, you should see something like the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    Workload: water_gmx50
        Executables: ['pre-process', 'execute-gen']
        Inputs: ['water_gmx50_bare']
        Tags: []
        Variables:
            size:
                Description: Workload size
                Default: 1536
                Suggested Values: ['0000.65', '0000.96', '0001.5', '0003', '0006', '0012', '0024', '0048', '0096', '0192', '0384', '0768', '1536', '3072']
            type:
                Description: Workload type.
                Default: pme
                Suggested Values: ['pme', 'rf']
            input_path:
                Description: Input path for water GMX50
                Default: {water_gmx50_bare}/{size}
    Workload: water_bare
        Executables: ['pre-process', 'execute-gen']
        Inputs: ['water_bare_hbonds']
        Tags: []
        Variables:
            size:
                Description: Workload size
                Default: 1536
                Suggested Values: ['0000.65', '0000.96', '0001.5', '0003', '0006', '0012', '0024', '0048', '0096', '0192', '0384', '0768', '1536', '3072']
            type:
                Description: Workload type.
                Default: pme
                Suggested Values: ['pme', 'rf']
            input_path:
                Description: Input path for water bare hbonds
                Default: {water_bare_hbonds}/{size}

Here we see that both of these workloads have a ``type`` variable (with
possible values of ``pme`` and ``rf``) and a ``size`` variable with a variety
of available sizes.

To determine a suggested software configuration, you can use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble info --attrs software_specs,compilers -v gromacs

With this command, you should see output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: console

  ##################
  # software_specs #
  ##################
  impi2018:
      pkg_spec: intel-mpi@2018.4.274

Package Manager Information
---------------------------

When learning how to use a new package manager in Ramble, it can be useful to
inspect the information of the package manager definition. To do this, execute
the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble info --type package_managers eessi

This should print a summary of the ``eessi`` definition, as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  Package Manager: eessi

  Description:
      Package manager definition for EESSI
      
          This package manager uses the European Environment for Scientific Software
          Installations to stream binaries from an EESSI mirror.
      
          https://www.eessi.io/
      
      
          To control the target architecture used, add EESSI_SOFTWARE_SUBDIR_OVERRIDE
          to the workspace's environment variable definitions.

  registered_phases:
      setup:
          write_module_commands

  package_manager_variables:
      eessi_version

Examining the ``package_manager_variables`` section, you can see that ``eessi``
has a defined variable named ``eessi_version``. To get more information about
this portion of the package manager definition, you can execute the following:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ramble info --type package_managers --attrs package_manager_variables -v eessi

Which should print something like the following output:

.. code-block:: console

  #############################
  # package_manager_variables #
  #############################
  eessi_version:
      Description: Version of EESSI to use
      Default: 2023.06
      Suggested Values: [None]

Here, we can see that the version of ``eessi`` can be contolled through the use
of the ``eessi_version`` variable definition. Defining this variable within an
experiment can allow you to parameterize the versions of EESSI used.

Configuring experiments
-----------------------

For this tutorial, you are going to focus on creating experiments from the
``water_bare`` and ``water_gmx50`` workloads. The default configuration will
contain experiments for each value of the ``type`` variable, and a single value
for the ``size`` variable.

You will use a Ramble workspace to manage these experiments.

Create and Activate a Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can configure your GROMACS experiments, you'll need to set up a
workspace. You can call this workspace ``eessi_gromacs``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace create eessi_gromacs

This will create a workspace for you in:

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RAMBLE_ROOT/var/ramble/workspaces/eessi_gromacs

Now you can activate the workspace and view its default configuration.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace activate eessi_gromacs

Alternatively, the workspace creation and activation can be combined in one command
with the activate flag (``-a``):

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace create eessi_gromacs -a

You can use the ``ramble workspace info`` command after editing configuration
files to see how ramble would use the changes you made.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace info

Configure the Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within the workspace directory, ramble creates a directory named ``configs``.
This directory contains generated configuration and template files. Each of
these files can be edited to configure the workspace, and examples will be
provided below.

The available files are:

 * ``ramble.yaml`` This file describes all aspects of the workspace. This includes the software stack, the experiments, and all variables.
 * ``execute_experiment.tpl`` This file is a template shell script that will be rendered to execute each of the experiments that ramble generates.

You can edit these files directly or with the command ``ramble workspace edit``.

To begin, you should edit the ``ramble.yaml`` file to set up the configuration
for your experiments. For this tutorial, replace the default yaml text with the
contents of ``$RAMBLE_ROOT/examples/eessi_gromacs_config.yaml``:

**NOTE**: This workspace utilizes the ``eessi`` package manager. As a result, it
requires ``eessi`` is installed following
`EESSI installation instructions <https://www.eessi.io/docs/getting_access/native_installation/>`_.
Modifications to the ``package_manager`` variant will change this behavior.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/gromacs_eessi_config.yaml
   :language: YAML

The second file you should edit is the ``execute_experiment.tpl`` template file.
This file contains a template script that will be rendered into an execution
script for each generated experiment. You can feel free to edit it as you need
to for your given system, but for this tutorial the default value will work.

Setting Up the Experiments
---------------------------

Now that the workspace is configured correctly, you can set up the experiments
in the active workspace using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace setup

This command will create experiment directories, download and expand input files,
and install the required software stack (and generate spack environments for
each workload).

It can take a bit to run depending on if you need to build new software and how
long the input files take to download. If you'd like to see what will be installed,
you can do a dry run of the setup using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace setup --dry-run

For each setup run, a set of logs will be created at:

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RAMBLE_ROOT/var/ramble/workspaces/$workspace_root/logs

Each run will have its own primary log, along with a folder containing a log
for each experiment that is being configured. While setup is running, you can
monitor the process by looking at the contents of:

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RAMBLE_ROOT/var/ramble/workspaces/eessi_gromacs/logs/setup.latest/gromacs.water_gmx50.pme_single_rank.out

Executing Experiments
---------------------

After the workspace is set up, its experiments can be executed. The two methods
to run the experiments are:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble on
   or;
    $ ./all_experiments

Analyzing Experiments
---------------------

Once the experiments within a workspace are complete, the experiments can be
analyzed. This is done through:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace analyze

This creates a ``results`` file in the root of the workspace that contains
extracted figures of merit. If the experiments were successful, this file will
show the following results:

* Core Time: CPU time (in seconds) spent on the benchmark calculations
* Wall Time: Elapsed real time (in seconds) spent on the benchmark calculations
* Percent Core Time: Core Time / Wall Time
* Nanosecs per day: Nanoseconds of simulation per day at the speed achieved
* Hours per nanosec: Hours required to calculate 1 nanosecond of simulation at
  the speed achieved

Workspace Directory Structure
-----------------------------

After analyzing the workspace, you can exmine the structure of the workspace at:

.. code-block:: console

    $ $RAMBLE_ROOT/var/ramble/workspaces/eessi_gromacs

Within this directory, you should see the following directories:

 * ``configs`` - Contains all of the configuration files for the workspace
 * ``experiments`` - Contains all of the experiment execution directories
 * ``inputs`` - Contains all of the input files needed for the experiments
 * ``logs`` - Contains all log files from any Ramble command that acts on the workspace
 * ``shared`` - Contains auxiliary files the experiment might need, such as environment variable information for licenses
 * ``software`` - Contains software environments for the experiments

Cleanup the Workspace
---------------------

Once you are finished with the tutorial content, ensure you have deactivated
the workspace using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace deactivate

Additionally, you can remove the workspace using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ramble workspace remove eessi_gromacs
