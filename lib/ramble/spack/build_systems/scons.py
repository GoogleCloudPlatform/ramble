    This class provides the following phases that can be overridden:

    1. :py:meth:`~.SConsPackage.build`
    2. :py:meth:`~.SConsPackage.install`

    Packages that use SCons as a build system are less uniform than packages
    that use other build systems. Developers can add custom subcommands or
    variables that control the build. You will likely need to override
    :py:meth:`~.SConsPackage.build_args` to pass the appropriate variables.
