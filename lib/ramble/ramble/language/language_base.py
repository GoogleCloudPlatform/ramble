        """Decorator for Ramble directives.

        Ramble directives allow you to modify a package while it is being
        defined, e.g. to add version or dependency information.  Directives are
        one of the key pieces of Ramble's application "language", which is
        embedded in python.

        Here's an example directive:

        .. code-block:: python

            @directive(dicts='workloads')
            workload('workload_name', ...):
                ...

        This directive allows you write:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Foo(ApplicationBase):
                workload(...)

        The ``@directive`` decorator handles a couple things for you:

          1. Adds the class scope (app) as an initial parameter when
             called, like a class method would.  This allows you to modify
             a package from within a directive, while the package is still
             being defined.

          2. It automatically adds a dictionary called "workloads" to the
             package so that you can refer to app.workloads.

        The ``(dicts='workloads')`` part ensures that ALL applications in
        Ramble will have a ``workloads`` attribute after they're constructed,
        and that if no directive actually modified it, it will just be an empty
        dict.

        This is just a modular way to add storage attributes to the Application
        class, and it's how Ramble gets information from the applications to
        the core.
