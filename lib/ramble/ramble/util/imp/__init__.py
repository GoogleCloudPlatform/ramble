"""Consolidated module for all imports done by Ramble.

Many parts of Ramble have to import Python code. This utility package
wraps Ramble's interface with Python's import system.

We do this because Python's import system is confusing and changes from
Python version to Python version, and we should be able to adapt our
approach to the underlying implementation.

Currently, this uses ``importlib.machinery`` where available and ``imp``
when ``importlib`` is not completely usable.

# TODO: (dwjacobsen) This logic matches spack v0.16.0.
#       The import logic should be updated to match v0.18.0
#       at some point in the future.
