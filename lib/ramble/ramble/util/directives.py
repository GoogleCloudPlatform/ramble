def define_directive_methods(obj_inst):

    Wrap each directive, and inject it into this class instance as a class
    method.

    This allows:

    self.<directive_name>(<directive_args>) to be called. As in:

    self.archive_pattern('*.log')

    Which can be called within `def __init__(self, file_path)` instead of
    having to call `archive_pattern('*.log')` at the class definition level.

    This function requires the object instance to have internal attributes:
    - '_directive_classes' - Dictionary mapping a directive to the class the
      directive is defined for
    - '_directive_functions' - Dictionary mapping a directive to the decorated function
      that defines the directive
    - '_language_classes' - A list of classes that language features should be "imported" from

    Both '_directive_classes' and '_directive_functions' are defined for all
    classes that use the DirectiveMeta meta-class.

    The '_language_classes' attribute is defined in ApplicationBase and ModifierBase.
