# ramble-python
#
# If you want to write your own executable Python script that uses Ramble
# modules, on Mac OS or maybe some others, you may be able to do it like
# this:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env ramble python
#
# Mac OS supports the above syntax, but it's not standard and most Linuxes
# don't support more than one argument after the shebang command.  This
# script is a workaround. Do this in your Python script instead:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env ramble-python
#
# This is compatible across platforms.
#
exec /usr/bin/env ramble python "$@"
